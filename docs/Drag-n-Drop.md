# [How to use](https://github.com/artem-barmin/obsidian-block-drag-n-drop#how-to-use)

You can see a drag-n-drop handler in the gutter. You can drag it and drop at line you want.

For now you can drag only list items, so handler will appear only near lines that belongs to list

## [Defaults](https://github.com/artem-barmin/obsidian-block-drag-n-drop#defaults)

- Drag and drop from one pane to another without modifiers will create embed link for the block. Id for block will be automatically created.
- Drag and drop in the same pane without modifiers will move the block.
- Drag and drop with "Shift" modifier will copy the block.

You can change behavior for settings in the plugin settings tab.
